# Lab 9: Latex and Rnw
**Author: Abigail Chaver**

In this lab we rewrite a previous project in Rnw format. 
The Rnw file and compiled pdf are included in the home directory.
However, they are dependent on all the files in the hw2 folder.
To recompile the pdf, go to stat159-fall2016-hw02/report/ and open report.Rnw.
The file can be compiled from that.
It will be identical in content to lab9.Rnw/ lab9.pdf.
